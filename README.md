# vim-php-jump
PHP code lookup alternative to tags for Vim.

Ever get tired of multiple tag definions? Have IDE envy when looking up a tag in Vim does not use the cursor context to figure out which tag to use? Welcome to vim-php-jump!

This is my first Vim plugin. It is not yet working. Don't use it. It is just an experiment, it may never work.
