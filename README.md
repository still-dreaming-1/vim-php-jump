# vim-php-jump
PHP code lookup alternative to tags for Vim.

Ever get tired of multiple tag name matches? Do you have IDE envy when jumping to the definition of some code using tags in Vim does not use the cursor context to figure out which tag to use? Welcome vim-php-jump!

vim-php-jump does not use or rely on tags. It does not depend have any dependencies or rely on any external parsers. It is written entirely in Vimscript. It also doesn't actually exist yet...

This is my first Vim plugin. It is not yet working. Don't use it. It is just an experiment, it may never work. I would love to pair or mob program with people on this! Get in contact with me, somehow, some way...
