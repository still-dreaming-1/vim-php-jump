PHP code lookup alternative to tags for Vim.

Ever get tired of multiple tag name matches? Do you have IDE envy when jumping to the definition of some code using tags in Vim does not use the cursor context to figure out which tag to use? Enter vim-php-jump!

vim-php-jump does not use or rely on tags. It does not depend or rely on any external parsers. It is written entirely in Vimscript.

This is my first Vim plugin. It doesn't do much yet. What it does do it not really in the spirit of this project description. This is just a starting point for me to learn from. I would love to pair or mob program with people on this! Get in contact with me, somehow, some way...

If you want to get an IDE quality version of a plugin like this, I requested the PhpStorm people make a plugin for Neovim. Check it out, and star it: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WI-30974
